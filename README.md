Use cmake to generate the build files (preferably outside of the source tree).

With cmake-gui, point your source code directory to:
[root-of-git-clone]/src

and point the binary directory somewhere else (outside of the src tree!).

Configure, Generate, and then build.

This has been tested to build on linux and windows.
